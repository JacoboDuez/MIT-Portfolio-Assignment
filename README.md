# MIT-Portfolio-Assignment
This set of HTML,CSS and JS (including bootstrap) is my first assignment for the MIT Fullstack development course and includes links to other projects developed throughout the course.
I include the Real time bus tracker, the navigation bar developed with bootstrap and other cool features such as a video describing me, what I like and what I have done through my carreer.
